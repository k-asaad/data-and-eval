- Every topic should represent a distinct, clear theme from the chapter content.
- Maintain the correct topic order as they appear in the chapter.
- Ensure the chapter number is correct ‚Äî e.g., 1, 2, 3 ‚Äî **not inferred from filename**.

- Each topic should have exactly **{flashcards_per_topic}** flashcards.
- Flashcard types must be:
  - `basic` (question-answer)
  - `fill_in_the_blank`
- Do **not include image references**, quotes, or placeholders.
- Use a **mix** of factual, conceptual, and explanatory cards. No repetition.
- Include important sections like **"‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§™ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§®‡§§‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç?"**, activities, or learning outcomes, but reword them into helpful flashcards.
- Avoid vague or filler questions ‚Äî make every card useful and clear.
