You are an expert NCERT SQL flashcard generator. Generate a full **PostgreSQL PL/pgSQL script** for the chapter **\"{chapter_name}\"** from Class {class_name}, Subject **\"{subject_name.capitalize()}\"**, Book Title: **\"{book_title}\"**.

- In this subject go through the pdf and fetch or generate meaningful topics name from the chapter give them a name don't just write 1.1, 1.2 etc text also the length of the topic must not be too big max 2 - 3 words.
- Don't make problem solving cards it is mathematics so make cards that are meaningful and helpful to learn concepts of mathematics like that no any problem solving type.
- This book contains topics and do you know sections so make sure all these are included in the flashcards but also make sure the questions and answers of that cards are meaningful because currently the cards are read only
- Create 5-6 topics from the chapter text and generate cards for each topic which are meaningful and relevant to the chapter.
- Also make sure the Chapter order is correct 1, 2, 3, etc.
-  Not only topic like 1.1 , 1.2 also some heading include that also 
- Generate the complete SQL block in one single output.
- Produce all topics in full, with all meaningful and non-repetitive flashcards related to each topic. No truncation, no splitting into multiple parts, no summarizing, no "add the rest" instructions, no placeholders.
- Output a single, complete, valid SQL block with proper escaping of single quotes. No markdown formatting. No explanations. Just the final SQL.
- Also: Do not stop in between. Make sure the entire chapter‚Äôs topics and cards are present in the single response, even if long.
- The format must exactly match the INSERT statements shown earlier. Each topic‚Äôs block must include all its cards and any sub-topic cards merged.
-- Ensure each topic has cards. All topics and subsections from the chapter text must be present.
- Also make sure the Chapter order is correct 1, 2, 3, etc.
- Also fetch the full name of the chapter.

---

üîö Final Output Requirement:
**Only return a full, working SQL block**. Do not output anything else. No Markdown, no comments, no "here's your SQL", just raw executable SQL text.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è TASK:
Generate a complete SQL script that:
1. Checks if the subject, book title, chapter, and topics exist before inserting. If not, insert and fetch their UUIDs using SELECT INTO, IF ... IS NULL THEN INSERT ... RETURNING INTO, etc.
3. For each topic, generates {flashcards_per_topic} meaningful flashcards (mix of types) with all single quotes escaped as two single quotes.
4. Uses only these tables and columns:
   - subjects: id, class_name, subject_name, icon, color, description, created_at
   - book_title: id, subject_id, title
   - chapters: id, book_id, name, order_index
   - topics: id, chapter_id, name, order_index
   - cards: id, topic_id, front, back, card_type, order_index
5. The script must be production-quality, error-free, and ready for Supabase SQL Editor. Do not use plain INSERTs without existence checks. Do not use markdown, comments, or explanations in the output. Do not stop mid-script.

---
## üìö INPUT STRUCTURE
- Class: {class_name}
- Subject: {subject_name.capitalize()} -- NOTE : here in the subject please write like this Physical Education and Wellbeing
- Book Title: {book_title}
- Book Icon: {book_icon}
- Book Color: {book_color}
- Language: {language} 
- Chapter Name: {chapter_name}
- Chapter Text: (see below)

## SAMPLE SQL STRUCTURE (STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS)
{sample_sql}

---
## ‚úÖ REQUIREMENTS
1. Extract the **actual chapter name** from the provided chapter text (not the filename).
    - also don't mention thing like Chapter1 : , or Unit 1: , only the chapter name in the sql.
2. Extract unique, relevant topics from the chapter text (use headings or infer if needed).
   -For this case the chapter have topic inside the pdf labelled as 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 or 2.1, 2.2 etc like this so the topic will be same as the number of marking like this in each chapter.
3. For each topic:
   - Generate **{flashcards_per_topic} meaningful flashcards** in {language}.
   - Mix types: `basic`, `fill_in_the_blank`.
   - Each card must have a non-empty question and answer.
   - No references to images, figures, or page numbers.
   - All single quotes in string values must be escaped as two single quotes.
4. SQL must include:
   - Existence checks and conditional inserts for all entities (subject, book title, chapter, topics)
   - Variable assignment for UUIDs
   - DO $$ DECLARE ... BEGIN ... END $$; blocks
   - RAISE NOTICE for success/failure
   - EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS for error handling
   - All values must use gen_random_uuid() for id
5. The entire script must be **complete, clean, and executable** in the Supabase SQL Editor.

---
## ‚ö†Ô∏è SQL STRING ESCAPING RULES (MANDATORY)
- Escape **all single quotes `'`** in string values using **two single quotes `''`**.
  - Example: `'Anand''s latest invention'`
- Do this for both `front` and `back` fields.
- Do **not** use backslashes or `\"` ‚Äî only use `''`.

---
## ‚úÖ SQL FORMAT RULES
- Use DO $$ DECLARE ... BEGIN ... END $$; blocks
- Use SELECT INTO, IF ... IS NULL THEN INSERT ... RETURNING INTO, etc.
- Use gen_random_uuid() for all new rows
- Only valid SQL compatible with Supabase
- Do NOT use plain INSERTs without existence checks
- Do NOT use markdown, comments, or explanations in the output

---
## ‚ö†Ô∏è FINAL ENFORCEMENT
- Do not skip any topic
- Do not include placeholders like:
  - `-- Add next topic here`
  - `-- Example cards`
- Only valid SQL
- Every topic must have {flashcards_per_topic} **complete** flashcards
- The script must run without errors in Supabase SQL Editor. If you use a table or column name that does not exist, the SQL will fail. Use only these columns:
  - subjects: id, class_name, subject_name, icon, color, description, created_at
  - book_title: id, subject_id, title
  - chapters: id, book_id, name, order_index
  - topics: id, chapter_id, name, order_index
  - cards: id, topic_id, front, back, card_type, order_index

---
# Chapter Text:
{chapter_text}

---
Return only the final, full SQL. Do not stop mid-script. Do not skip any topic. Do not use markdown.
